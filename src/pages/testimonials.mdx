# Testimonials

## Carolyn S. Glenview, Illinois.

> Dear John, When our Mason and Hamlin joined our household last November, 
> I commented that the emotional process was similar the that of adopting a baby -
> a bit of apprehension mixed with a great desire to build a wonderful relationship.
> I would guess that the analogy of the adoptive process would be a bit the same for you.
> You put a great deal of energy and skill and, and yes
> love for the product into what you do and then see it go out the door
> (hopefully forever). In keeping with todayâ€™s practices of staying in touch with the
> birth parent, I just want you to know how much I love my piano and think of the
> Mason and Hamlin company and you with much gratitude every day I enjoy the instrument.
> I could not be happier!
> 
> Thanks again! \
> Carolyn S. Glenview, Illinois.


## George S, Lake Forest College, Lake Forest, Illinois

> Dear John: You might call yourself a Piano Technician,
> but I would call you a Miracle Worker! When I learned that EMINE NAOUMOFF,
> the Bulgarian-born world-class concert pianist, composer, conductor,
> and professor had agreed to play at LAKE FOREST COLLEGE,
> I was delighted but also fearful that our seven-foot Steinway might not be
> the appropriate vehicle for his remarkable talent.
> Despite the work that you did on it over the summer, I was concerned that
> the piano would not live up to his expectations,
> especially after seeing the program he proposed to perform.
> You came to our rescue and, in under three weeks, you had that Steinway
> in remarkable condition.
> Your indefatigable work on the action and voicing of the piano gave him
> an instrument that he was pleased to play, one that make you and us proud!
> Thank you very much!
> 
> Most sincerely, \
> George S, Lake Forest College, Lake Forest, Illinois
